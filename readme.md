# Frankie

Frankie is a base WordPress theme built on HTML5 and Sass. It's not meant as a parent theme but a quick-start base for WordPress website production. All the goodness a starter theme should have, but none of the fluff.

## Features
- Responsive base (I suggest adding [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/))
- Includes [Modernizer](http://modernizr.com/) for feature detection and cross-browser compatibility (development version)
- Mobile-friendly menu (example at [littlebitnerdy.com](http://littlebitnerdy.com))
- Wigetized and custom menu ready
- Preconfigured for Compass (including moving style.css to template root once processed)
- Custom comments layout (through functions.php) and custom comment form (inc/respond.php)
- Some pre-populated HTML5 tags
- Post thumbnails and post format enabled
- [Normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) CSS reset included (slightly customised)
- Scripts enqueued through functions.php
- Latest jQuery
- _globapwp.scss file for targeting WordPress generated elements
- Asynchronous Google Analytics script in place (just edit the ID)
- Not much else.

## Setup
1. Run a search for all terms 'frankywp'. Replace with your theme name
2. Move the config.rb file somewhere safe (your preprocessor may overwrite it)
3. Set up the folder in your preprocessor of choice (i.e. Codekit)
4. Replace the config.rb file
